# Koala42 Assessment - Frontend (in Vue)

### Description
1) In this project I'm using VueJS and Tailwind CSS
2) I'm using TypeScript and types are in /app/types.ts and in component's folders as types.ts
3) Main code is in app/components/...
4) There is a transformation of json file in /src/utils/transformData.ts

### Installation
Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DanilaAnikin/koala-fe-vue.git
cd koala-fe-vue
npm install
```

Running:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Issues and posible improvements
#### Responsive styles
I could add styles so the table is responsive and looks good either on mobile.

#### Connecting with BE
Of course I could connect this code with my BE, already created code ( at github.com/DanilaAnikin/koala42-assessment-hiring/ )

#### Style and design
If I spent more time on that, I could manage the design and correct my styles so it looks better. 
In the assessment was that I don't have to spend much time on that, so I didn't.
